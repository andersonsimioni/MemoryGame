# Memory game with applyed logic

This is a classic memory game with mathematics functions applied to increase the difficulty, our mission is to work with memory and logic at the same time,
the player has 2 missions, remembers a card, and knows what's the result of the equation. The card pairs are mathematics functions and result in X and Y coordinates,
the coordinates X,Y point to F(X) = Y.

The project was based on pure web programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JS, also we used frameworks such as Bootstrap-4, JQuery and Sweet Alerts.
There are not back-end applications running on server-side, this is a pure front-end web application.
